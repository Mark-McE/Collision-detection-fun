# Collision-detection-fun
Just for fun, exploring Erlang language with some collision detection algorithms


Coding challenge Task:  
without any imports, create  class / types/ objects for:  
Circle  
Polygon  
Line Segment  
Point  
Arc Segment <-- ED: this one is more complicated than it looks at first glance, you can do if you want
                    
Implement detection of collision for these objects. The collision detection
should be compatible with any of the objects listed. Even tangential connection
at a single point counts as a collision.

Assume a 2-D plane with all objects aligned coplanar to it. Collision detection
must be implemented with no margin of error
